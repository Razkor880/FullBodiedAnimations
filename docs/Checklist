CHECKLIST
PHASE 0 — FOUNDATION (COMPLETE)

Goal: Plugin boots, runs, and owns its lifecycle.

 Create SKSE plugin (FBPlugin)

 Logging initialized and visible

 FBConfig loads initial snapshot

 Generation system exists and increments

 FBUpdate pump starts and ticks

 Papyrus registration works

 Manual test hooks (test event injection)

Checkpoint:
Plugin loads, logs generation, update pump ticks.

PHASE 1 — EVENT PIPELINE (COMPLETE)

Goal: Prove end-to-end event → execution.

 FBEvents queue implemented (Push / Drain)

 Events persist until drained

 FBUpdate drains every tick

 Event → script mapping via snapshot

 Command dispatch by type

 Transform command executes visibly in game

Checkpoint:
A config-defined event causes a visible head scale in game.
✔ ACHIEVED

PHASE 2 — FBTransform STABILIZATION (IN PROGRESS)

Goal: Make transform system correct, safe, and reusable.

 Clean FBTransform API (ApplyScale, etc.)

 Resolve actor correctly (1P/3P aware)

 Node lookup hardened

 Remove retry/requeue logic (temporary)

 Add reset / absolute vs relative semantics

 Ensure no per-tick reapplication unless intended

Checkpoint:
Transforms apply reliably to player and NPCs without hacks.

PHASE 3 — FBMorph (NEXT)

Goal: Add morph support using the same command pipeline.

 FBMorph module created

 Morph commands dispatched from FBUpdate

 RaceMenu slider / expression application

 Snapshot-driven, generation-aware

 No dependency on FBTransform internals

Checkpoint:
A config event drives a visible morph change.

PHASE 4 — TWEENING (DEFERRED)

Goal: Smooth, time-based transitions.

 Shared TweenSpec interpretation

 FBTransform supports tweened scale

 FBMorph supports tweened morph

 Easing types implemented

 Tween state stored outside FBUpdate

Checkpoint:
Transforms/morphs interpolate over time correctly.

PHASE 5 — FBState (FUTURE)

Goal: Gameplay state manipulation.

 FBState module introduced

 Commands for AI, controls, flags, etc.

 Explicit separation from FBFx

PHASE 6 — TOOLING / OAR (FAR FUTURE)

Goal: Authoring and live editing support.

 Config hot-reload hardened

 Optional OAR UI integration

 Runtime editing without restart (best-effort)

OPERATING RULES (RE-CANONIZED)

No feature advances without checklist update

Stabilize before extending

Prefer clarity over cleverness

Old project files are reference only

If something works, identify why before abstracting it
